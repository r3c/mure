Overview
--------

Mure is a regular expression engine able to bind several pattern/value pairs
and return the value associated to matched pattern when applied. This allows
forward-only text parsing while mapping each matched sequence to corresponding
value, which is a efficient solution for tokenization tasks e.g. when writing
lexers.

Usage
-----

There is no user documentation available yet, sorry!
